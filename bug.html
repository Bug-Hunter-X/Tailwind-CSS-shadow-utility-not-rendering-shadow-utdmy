This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  However, if the `shadow-lg` class doesn't produce the desired shadow effect, it could be due to a missing or incorrect configuration of Tailwind's shadow utilities in your project. This could be an issue in projects where you have multiple CSS frameworks or styles conflicting with Tailwind's shadow implementation.
