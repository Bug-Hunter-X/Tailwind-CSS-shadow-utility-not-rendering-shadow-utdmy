```html
<!-- Ensure your Tailwind configuration is correct and that the shadow utility is included -->
<!-- Verify that other CSS frameworks or styles are not overriding the shadow styles -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured to include the shadow plugin and that your CSS is correctly imported into your HTML.  Also carefully check your CSS for any conflicting styles that might be unintentionally overriding Tailwind's shadow classes.  If using other CSS frameworks or libraries, ensure they don't interfere with Tailwind's styling.
